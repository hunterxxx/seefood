# SeeFood with TensorFlow (1.0.1) Image Classifier Gradle Standalone Port

- Clone the project
- Import it on Android Studio
- Run it
- That's all.

This is a project that I used TensorFlow Image Classifier sample to build it up quickly.

It has a trained hotdog classifier file in seefood/app/src/main/assets/rounded_graph_optimized.pb

It is available on Google Play Store.

I am not planning to maintain it. If you want an updated version, build it yourself.

# Lastly, Have fun!
